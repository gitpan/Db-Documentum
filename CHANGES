1.0   Mon Jan 25 14:54:55 EST 1999
	- Some changes to the Tools.pm module.  Added username
	  optional argument to dm_KrbConnect to satisfy my own
	  needs for shared, anonymous accounts.
	  Added corresponding code to dm_check_password.pl on server
	  side to handle shared accounts. 
	  Releasing as version 1.0 just so it doesn't look so beta.
1.01  (same day) :-)
	- Make test.pl better.  Fixed MANIFEST problem (I renamed CHANGES).
	  It helps to test BEFORE you upload. :-)
1.1   
    - Added hooks and fixes for easy building under NT.  Added nicer
	  non-Solaris OS handling in general to Makefile.PL.
    - Added dmAPIInit() and dmAPIDeinit() calls in module to automate
      this.  This will require programs that have these functions in
	  them to remove them, as they're not necessary.
    - Cleaned up test suite and simplified it.
1.2
    - Moved automated dmAPIInit() and dmAPIDeInit() code out of .XS file 
      and into .PM file.
    - Restructured variable declarations in C preamble of XS code so it
      compiles more easily on Win NT.
    - Fixed dm_Connect() in Tools module to behave differently (correctly)
      under UNIX and Win NT.
    - Added dm_CreateType() and dm_CreateObject() to Tools module.
    - Created tools_test.pl to test new features of Tools module.
